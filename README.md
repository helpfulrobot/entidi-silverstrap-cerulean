silverstrap-cerulean
====================

An extension to [Silverstrap](http://dev.entidi.com/p/silverstrap/) that
uses the [Cerulean](http://bootswatch.com/cerulean/) theme instead of
the plain [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) theme.

The silverstrap-cerulean 2.x.x branch is based on silverstrap-2 that in
turn is based on Bootstrap 3. The still maintained master-1.0 branch is
based on silverstrap-1 that in turn is based on Bootstrap 2.

Installation
------------

With composer:

    composer require entidi/silverstrap-cerulean

Without composer you must manually install Silverstrap before. After
that, download [the tarball](https://github.com/ntd/silverstrap-cerulean/releases),
unpack it under the `themes` directory and rename to `silverstrap_Object`.

This is not a standalone theme but a customization of Silverstrap. This
means there is not such thing as the `silverstrap-cerulean` theme:
you must enable `silverstrap` in the CMS or in your YAML configuration.

Support
-------

For bug reports or feature requests, go to the dedicated [development
tracker](http://dev.entidi.com/p/silverstrap-cerulean/).
